# Lab 2 - CSS For All Occasions

CSS's job is to describe the *appearance* of a web page. In this lab, you will generate the content and describe it using the HTML tags that you know, and then you will style it and give it visual appeal using CSS classes, selectors, and styles.

## Lab Description

You may choose to work in **pairs** for this lab. As a team, you will submit one project. Include two meta author tags or include both names in a comment block at the top of your source file.

Use the project on page 129 of the text as a reference for what we are kind of going for here.

Imagine you are building a simple web page for your business. Give your business a name, a slogan, and whatever other flavor you might want. Describe what your business does, its location, services, hours of operation, and whatever else strikes your fancy. Think only HTML while you generate the content, though you may wish to add some `class` attributes at this point for future use.

When you've got the content fleshed out, add some CSS. Use a separate CSS file and link it using a `<link>` tag. Use colors everywhere you can think to, but try to keep them somewhat tasteful. Use resources from the text or various other linked resource websites on the Canvas page. Your CSS file must include at least a couple rules that change 2-3 CSS properties so that you can get used to organizing your code and getting things syntactically correct.

Some CSS properties that you may wish to play with:

* `font-family`
* `font-variant`
* `color`
* `background-color`
* `text-align`
* `text-decoration`
* `text-transform`
* `border-style`
* `border-width`
* margin and padding properties

You are free to use any css properties that are in the text or that you dig up online to get the result you are looking for. Ask the instructor if you have questions about how to achieve a particular effect. Think about what you want it to look like first, and then think about what CSS you will need to make it happen. Have fun with this!
